# Snails: A Fascinating Journey

## Example Code

<pre>
<code data-line-numbers="1|2|3-5|24"> let snail = 3
function snailJourney() {
    console.log("Snails are amazing creatures!");
    return snail * 2;
}

function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

function calculateGoldenRatio() {
    return (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2;
}

function fibonacciSequence(n) {
    let sequence = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sequence.push(fibonacci(i));
    }
    return sequence;

function main() {
    console.log("Snail Journey Result: " + snailJourney());
    console.log("Fibonacci of 5: " + fibonacci(5));

## Introduction to Snails

Snails are gastropod mollusks, known for their coiled shells and slow movement. They play an essential role in ecosystems.

## Anatomy of a Snail

### Key Features

- **Shell**: Provides protection.
- **Foot**: Used for locomotion.
- **Radula**: A tongue-like organ with tiny teeth.

### Formula: Shell Spiral Growth

The growth of a snail's shell can be modeled using the logarithmic spiral:
$$
r = a e^{b\theta}
$$
Where:

- $r$: Radius
- $\theta$: Angle
- $a, b$: Constants

## Snail Habitats

Snails are found in diverse environments:

- **Terrestrial**: Forests, gardens.
- **Aquatic**: Freshwater and marine ecosystems.

## Snail Reproduction

Snails are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs.

### Formula: Population Growth

The exponential growth of a snail population can be expressed as:
$$
P(t) = P_0 e^{rt}
$$
Where:

- $P(t)$: Population at time $t$
- $P_0$: Initial population
- $r$: Growth rate

## Snails in Culture

Snails have been symbols of:

- **Patience**: Due to their slow movement.
- **Resilience**: Their ability to adapt to harsh conditions.

<blockquote>
"Slow and steady wins the race." – Aesop's Fables
</blockquote>

## Conclusion

Snails are more than just slow-moving creatures; they are vital to ecosystems, fascinating in their biology, and rich in cultural symbolism.
